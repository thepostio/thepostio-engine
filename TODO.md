## Features
**Accept cookie popup** because it complies to GDPR.

**Display tags** on articles and article listing.


**Link by tags** so that one can click on a tag and find articles with the same tag, ordered by "average number of visits" per days since the first visit.

**Flag an article** with a given category so that it does not contain too explicit or illegal content. If an article is flagged, based on the category, it may not be displayed (if illegal, hate/racism or p0rn), it may be displayed but only after a disclaimer or a modal that covers it (defamation, copyright infringement). A user may be banned for publishing illegal/hate posts, so that even it's non-flagged content is no longer accessible.

**Popular articles** to be displayed on the front page. This will feature categories:
- popular in the last 3 days
- popular in the last 15 days

**Visit metrics**. Each article will show a plot (per day) of how many unique visitors it has got in the last 30 days. It will also display a total unique visit count and the average number of visits per day since the first visit.
